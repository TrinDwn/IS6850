1.	Return the first name, department, hire date and country of the first and last employee hired

		(SELECT first_name, department, hire_date, country
		FROM employees e INNER JOIN regions r
		ON e.region_id = r.region_id
		WHERE hire_date = (SELECT MIN(hire_date) FROM employees e2)
		LIMIT 1)
		UNION ALL 
		SELECT first_name, department, hire_date, country
		FROM employees e INNER JOIN regions r
		ON e.region_id = r.region_id
		WHERE hire_date = (SELECT MAX(hire_date) FROM employees e2)

2.	Write a query that shows the student's name, the courses the student is taking and the professors that teach that course.

		SELECT student_name, se.course_no, p.last_name
		FROM students s
		INNER JOIN student_enrollment se
  		  ON s.student_no = se.student_no
		INNER JOIN teach t
   		 ON se.course_no = t.course_no
		INNER JOIN professors p
  		  ON t.last_name = p.last_name
		ORDER BY student_name;

3.	Let's say we only care to see a single professor teaching a course and we don't care for all the other professors that teach the particular course. Write a query that will accomplish this so that every record is distinct.
	
  SELECT student_name, course_no, min(last_name)
	FROM (
	SELECT student_name, se.course_no, p.last_name
	FROM students s
	INNER JOIN student_enrollment se
	    ON s.student_no = se.student_no
	INNER JOIN teach t
	    ON se.course_no = t.course_no
	INNER JOIN professors p
	    ON t.last_name = p.last_name
	    ) a
	    GROUP BY student_name, course_no
	    ORDER BY student_name, course_no;

4.	Write a query that returns employees whose salary is above average for their given department.
	
  SELECT first_name
  	FROM employees outer_emp
  	WHERE salary > (
  	SELECT AVG(salary)
    	FROM employees
    	WHERE department = outer_emp.department);

5.	Write a query that returns ALL of the students as well as any courses they may or may not be taking.
		
    SELECT s.student_no, student_name, course_no
		FROM students s LEFT JOIN student_enrollment se
		 ON s.student_no = se.student_no
